# Galeria Shqiptare - Design Document

## Introduction

Galeria Shqiptare is a web application dedicated to showcasing the stunning beauty of Albanian places through a curated collection of photographs. This design document provides an overview of the technical implementation of the project, focusing solely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which constitute the frontend development stack.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies

- **HTML**: HTML is used for structuring the content of the web pages, providing the foundation for the user interface.
  
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are employed for styling the HTML elements, ensuring visual consistency and aesthetic appeal across the application.
  
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is utilized to enhance the interactivity and functionality of the website, enabling dynamic content updates and user engagement.

## Architecture

### Single Page Application (SPA)

Galeria Shqiptare adopts a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture, where all content is dynamically loaded within a single HTML page. JavaScript, along with AJAX requests, is leveraged to fetch data from the server and update the DOM without requiring page reloads.

### Modular Design

The application follows a modular design approach, with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for different components and functionalities. This modular structure promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

### Responsive Design

Galeria Shqiptare is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction experiences across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. CSS media queries are used to adapt the layout and styling based on the device characteristics.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Asynchronous Data Loading**: AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests are utilized to asynchronously fetch data from the server, enhancing the user experience by minimizing page load times and providing seamless content updates.

2. **CSS Frameworks**: While the project does not rely on CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation, it follows similar principles of grid-based layout and responsive design to ensure consistency and flexibility in styling.

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: The application is designed with progressive enhancement in mind, ensuring that core functionality remains accessible even in environments where JavaScript may be disabled or unsupported.

4. **Accessibility**: Accessibility considerations are integrated into the design process, with emphasis on semantic HTML, proper use of ARIA roles and attributes, and keyboard navigation support to ensure that the website is usable by all users, including those with disabilities.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Galeria Shqiptare is a frontend-focused web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The architecture emphasizes modularity, responsiveness, and accessibility, providing users with an engaging and visually appealing experience as they explore the beauty of Albanian places through photographs.
